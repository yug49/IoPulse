          Your input is a JSON object containing an investor's profile. Your task is to generate a list of 15 potential investment candidates.

          Follow these steps:
          1. Use the `listing coins` tool to get a broad list of active cryptocurrencies.
          2. Based on the "desired_market_cap" from the input profile, filter this list.
          3. For the filtered list, use the `get coin quotes` tool to check for sufficient 24-hour trading volume to ensure liquidity.
          4. Your final output must be a single JSON array of the ticker symbols for the top 15 candidates. Example: ["BTC", "ETH", "SOL", ...]
